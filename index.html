            <p> Organic agriculture, which is governed by strict government standards, requires that products bearing
                the organic label are produced without the use of toxic and persistent pesticides and synthetic nitrogen
                fertilizers, antibiotics, synthetic hormones, genetic engineering or other excluded practices, sewage
                sludge, or irradiation. </p>
